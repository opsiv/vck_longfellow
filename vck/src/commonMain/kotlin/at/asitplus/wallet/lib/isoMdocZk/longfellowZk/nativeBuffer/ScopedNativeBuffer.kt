/**
 * A scoped wrapper around a malloc'ed native buffer.
 *
 * This class guarantees that the underlying native memory is always freed
 * after use. It is **not thread‑safe** and cannot be constructed directly.
 *
 * Typical usage:
 * ```
 * val (blockReturnValue, buffer) = ScopedNativeBuffer { byteArrayPointer, byteArrayLengthPointer ->
 *     // Call some native function that writes into byteArrayPointer and byteArrayLengthPointer
 *     // The lambda's last expression becomes blockReturnValue
 * }
 * // `blockReturnValue` is whatever the block returned,
 * // `buffer` is a copy of the native memory contents
 * ```
 *
 * The buffer is automatically freed once the block completes, even if an
 * exception is thrown. Callers never see a `ScopedNativeBuffer` instance
 * directly; the only public entry point is [invoke].
